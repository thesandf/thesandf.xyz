# DAIP Audit Challenge: Defend the Decentralized IP Multiverse üèóÔ∏è‚ú®

**Mission**: Channel your inner **Iron Man**, **Naruto**, or **Link** and step into the DAIP multiverse!
Your goal: audit the [Decentralized Autonomous Intellectual Property (DAIP) Platform](https://github.com/thesandf/DAIPs) - a DAO-governed NFT marketplace for tokenized IP.

Hunt for bugs in its **governance** and **bidding systems**, sharpen your auditor skills, and help secure the blockchain multiverse.

Because even **Tony Stark‚Äôs armor has weak spots**‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs your job to find them.

---

## Overview

The **DAIP Platform** is a decentralized ecosystem for trading, governing, and protecting intellectual property NFTs on Ethereum.

It runs on two core smart contracts:

1. **DAIPMarketplace.sol** ‚Äì A marketplace for DAIP NFTs, built on ERC-721 with governance-controlled minting, royalties, bidding, and metadata management.
2. **GovernanceToken.sol** ‚Äì An ERC-20 governance token that powers DAO decisions, proposals, and permissions.

## üîë Contract Highlights

### DAIPMarketplace.sol

* Governance-only NFT minting
* USDC-based marketplace (royalties + platform fees)
* Bidding with expiry, increments, and escrow
* Transfer restrictions, metadata freezing, and royalty updates
* Admin + governance controls for fees and permissions

### GovernanceToken.sol

* ERC-20 with delegation + voting power tracking
* Role-based permissions (minting, vesting, locking)
* Timelocked proposals with category-based execution
* IPFS-linked proposal metadata

##  Why Join the DAIP Audit Challenge?

### Blind Audit = Real Practice

Contracts are anonymized for **unbiased learning** - just like real contests (Code4rena, Sherlock).

### Community & Recognition

Submit findings via GitHub or X (@THE_SANDF). Top submissions will get **featured, credited, and celebrated**.

### Grow as an Auditor

From common pitfalls (reentrancy, access control) to deeper governance edge cases - this challenge will **level you up**.

---

## Rewards (Non-Monetary)

* **Recognition:** Listed in the **Hall of Heroes** on [thesandf.xyz](https://thesandf.xyz) + shoutouts on X.
* **Community Perks:** Early access to case studies, badges, and beta invites.
* **Portfolio Value:** Add professional-style reports to your **auditing portfolio**.

---

##  How to Participate

### 1. Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thesandf/DAIPs.git
cd DAIPs && forge install
forge test
forge create --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> src/DAIP.sol
```

Explore the contracts:

* `GovernanceToken.sol` ‚Üí DAO voting + permissions
* `DAIPMarketplace.sol` ‚Üí NFT minting + trading

### 2. Audit the Contracts

* **Analyze:** Hunt for reentrancy, broken access control, escrow issues, logic flaws.
* **Exploit:** Build a Foundry PoC (`.t.sol`).
* **Fix:** Propose mitigations (e.g. Checks-Effects-Interactions).
* **Tools:** Foundry, Slither, manual review.

### 3. Write Your Report

Use this template:

```markdown
### [S-#] TITLE  

**Description:**  
Explain the issue.  

**Impact:**  
What‚Äôs at risk?  

**Proof of Concept:**  
Code snippet / Foundry test.  

**Recommended Mitigation:**  
Suggested fix.  
```

### 4. Submit

* **GitHub Issues** ‚Üí structured reports.
* **GitHub Discussions** ‚Üí share, debate, and get feedback.
* **X (@THE_SANDF)** ‚Üí post snippets, e.g.:

  > "Spotted a reentrancy bug in DAIP Audit Challenge üö® Check my PoC: [link] #DAIPAudit"

**Rule of Honor:** Stay blind - don‚Äôt reference solved bugs elsewhere.

## üí° Tips for Success

* Start small: find medium/low bugs, then aim higher.
* Keep an eye on common issues: reentrancy, unchecked state updates, improper permissions.
* Use Foundry tests for speed.
* Never deploy vulnerable contracts to mainnet.
* Share detailed findings ‚Üí stronger portfolio impact.

##  Closing Call

The multiverse needs defenders.
Your audit report might be the difference between **a secure DAO** and **a billion-dollar exploit**.

So - assemble, sharpen your tools, and let‚Äôs secure the DAIP multiverse together.
