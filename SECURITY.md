## Reporting a Vulnerability
Thank you for responsibly disclosing security issues - we take them seriously.

**Preferred contact (private):**
- Create a private security issue on this GitHub repo (use the "Security" â†’ "Report a vulnerability" flow), or
- Email: currently unavailable (PGP key available on request).

If you use email, please include:
- A short summary of the issue
- Affected contract/address and chain (if on-chain)
- Proof-of-concept (PoC) or reproduction steps (preferably runnable on a mainnet fork)
- Block numbers / TX hashes (if applicable)
- Your preferred contact method and timeline for disclosure

## Response Process & Timeline
We aim to:
- Acknowledge receipt within **3 business days**
- Provide an initial assessment within **2 weeks**
- Coordinate fix timelines and disclosure with affected parties

If you believe the issue is actively being exploited, please mark the subject line: **[EMERGENCY]**.

## Guidelines for Proofs-of-Concept
- **Do not** include exploits that enable theft on mainnet without clear mitigations or redaction.
- Use **mainnet forks** or testnets for reproduction steps and label such code `# FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES` or `sensitive: true`.
- If you need help preparing a safe PoC, we can assist after initial contact.

## Public Disclosures & Credits
We will coordinate public disclosure with affected projects. Reporters who follow responsible disclosure will be credited (unless they request anonymity).
