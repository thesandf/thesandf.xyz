## Vulnerability Case Study Format

To contribute a vulnerability case study (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan exploits), use this format to keep things consistent and epic. Think of it as scripting a Marvel-style showdown or an anime boss fight!

# <Vuln Name>: <One-liner impact>

## TL;DR
- **What‚Äôs the bug?**: Describe the vulnerability in 1-2 sentences.
- **Why it matters**: Explain the impact (e.g., funds lost, protocol risks).
- **How to fix**: Summarize the mitigation in 1-2 sentences.

## üé¨ Story Time
Tell the exploit‚Äôs story like it‚Äôs an MCU battle, anime arc, or raid boss encounter. Make it engaging! (100-200 words)

## Attack Flow
Step-by-step breakdown of how the exploit works. Use bullet points or numbered steps for clarity.

### Actors / Roles
- List key players (e.g., attacker, protocol, users) and their roles.

## Example Values (if any)
Provide sample inputs/outputs (e.g., token amounts, gas costs) to illustrate the attack.

## Vulnerable Pattern
```solidity
// Short code snippet showing the vulnerable pattern
```
Explain why this code is exploitable (1-2 paragraphs).

## Proof of Exploit (Foundry)
```solidity
// Foundry test code demonstrating the attack
```
Include test output or logs to show the exploit in action.

## Fixed Pattern (if any)
```solidity
// Code snippet with the fix
```
Explain why this mitigates the vulnerability (1-2 paragraphs).

## Auditor‚Äôs Checklist
- [ ] What to search for in code review (e.g., specific patterns or keywords).
- [ ] Tests/fuzz ideas to catch this bug.
- [ ] Common false positives to avoid during audits.

## Real-world references (if any)
- Link to similar issues or past hacks (e.g., Chainalysis reports, post-mortems).

## Notes
Extra details, such as gas/security tradeoffs or edge cases.


### Example Submission
See `/case-studies/reentrancy-example.md` for a sample case study on a reentrancy attack.

## Guidelines
- **Be Clear**: Write for both newbies and pros. Explain technical terms where needed.
- **Stay Thematic**: Lean into the MCU/anime/gaming vibe where it fits (e.g., ‚ÄúThanos-level exploit‚Äù).
- **Test Code**: Ensure any Solidity/Foundry code compiles and runs.
- **Credit Sources**: Cite references (e.g., Chainalysis, Code4rena) for real-world hacks.
- **Be Respectful**: Keep discussions constructive and inclusive.
