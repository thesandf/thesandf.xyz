 Web3 Security Case Studies & Tools | Reproducing DeFi Hacks, CTFs, and Audit Guides with MCU, Anime & Gaming Storytelling

## About TheSandF

I’m **TheSandF**, a Web3 security researcher and aspiring smart contract auditor, channeling **Iron Man’s precision**, **Naruto’s grit**, and **Link’s problem-solving** to hunt vulnerabilities like **reentrancy loops**, **MEV sandwich attacks**, and **bridge heists** that drained over **$2B in 2025 (Chainalysis)**.

This repo is my **multiverse HQ**-a place to:

* 🕵️‍♂️ **Reproduce DeFi hacks**: Dissect exploits with code + fixes (e.g., *Thor vs. The Bifrost*, 1,313 words).
* 🏆 **Tackle CTFs & challenges**: Sharpen audit skills with Code4rena, Sherlock, sol-bug-bench.
* 🌍 **Contribute to Web3**: Share mock audits and tools to strengthen the ecosystem.

**Mission**: Analyze **$1B+ in hacks**, build a rock-solid audit track record, and empower the **next generation of Web3 defenders**.
