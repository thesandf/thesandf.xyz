# TheSandF.xyz   

Welcome to **TheSandF.xyz**, where **Web3 security meets pop culture**!
Inspired by the MCU’s epic showdowns, anime’s resilience, and legendary boss fights, this repo is a hub for battling DeFi’s darkest exploits.

## About TheSandF 🏗️

I’m **TheSandF**, a Web3 security researcher and aspiring smart contract auditor, channeling **Iron Man’s precision**, **Naruto’s grit**, and **Link’s problem-solving** to hunt vulnerabilities like **reentrancy loops**, **MEV sandwich attacks**, and **bridge heists** that drained over **$2B in 2025 (Chainalysis)**.

This repo is my **multiverse HQ**-a place to:

* 🕵️‍♂️ **Reproduce DeFi hacks**: Dissect exploits with code + fixes (e.g., *Thor vs. The Bifrost*,).
* 🏆 **Tackle CTFs & challenges**: Sharpen audit skills with Code4rena, Sherlock, sol-bug-bench.
* 🌍 **Contribute to Web3**: Share mock audits and tools to strengthen the ecosystem.

**Mission**: Analyze **$1B+ in hacks**, build a rock-solid audit track record, and empower the **next generation of Web3 defenders**.
