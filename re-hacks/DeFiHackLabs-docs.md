# Hands-on with DeFiHackLabs - Practice Real DeFi Exploits Safely

Welcome, defenders of the multiverse! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

At **TheSandF.xyz**, we don‚Äôt just read stories about DeFi hacks - we **practice them safely**, learn the mechanics, and understand how to defend against them. This post invites you to dive into **DeFiHackLabs**, a Foundry-based collection of reproduced DeFi exploits, and turn theory into hands-on skills.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Safety first:** All exercises are **local only**. Never deploy vulnerable contracts to mainnet. Use ephemeral environments like Foundry/Anvil.

##  Why practice?

Each case study on TheSandF.xyz (e.g., *Black Widow - Red Room Vault*) tells a story of a hack. Now you can:

* Move from **story ‚Üí PoC ‚Üí run locally ‚Üí inspect ‚Üí patch**
* Explore the mechanics of real-world exploits: Access Control, Reentrancy, Oracle manipulation, and more
* Build confidence in auditing and reproducing vulnerabilities safely
* Contribute back to the community with insights, fixes, or improved tests

Hands-on practice is the fastest way to **master Web3 security**.

##  Get started

From your local clone of **thesandf.xyz**:

```bash
# initialize submodule (if not already)
git submodule update --init re-hacks/DeFiHackLabs

# enter the practice folder
cd re-hacks/DeFiHackLabs

# install Foundry if needed:
# https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation

# run all PoCs / tests
forge test
```

To try a single PoC (example):

```bash
forge test --match-test testExploitBlackWidow
```

---

## üèÅ Recommended workflow

1. Pick a case study from TheSandF.xyz (e.g., *Black Widow*).
2. Scroll to the `vuln` block - note `source_local`, `test_name`, and `source_permalink`.
3. If you just want to **read the PoC**, open `source_permalink`.
4. To **run it locally**, clone the repo with submodules and run the corresponding test:

   ```bash
   cd re-hacks/DeFiHackLabs
   forge test --match-test <test_name>
   ```
5. Inspect the code, experiment with assertions, or try a minimal patch to see how mitigation works.
6. Share your learning - open a PR, submit a discussion, or add notes to the case study.

## üéì What you‚Äôll learn

By practicing, you‚Äôll understand:

* How exploits are encoded as reproducible PoC tests
* Attacker flows for different vulnerability classes (Access Control, Reentrancy, Oracle issues, etc.)
* How to verify fixes using tests
* How to safely experiment with mitigations

Hands-on experience bridges the gap between reading about hacks and defending real-world protocols.

---

## Ethics & safety

* **Local practice only** - never deploy vulnerable contracts to live networks.
* Use ephemeral test environments (Anvil / Foundry).
* Discover a live vulnerability? Follow responsible disclosure. Do **not** exploit.
